# University-Course-Pre-registration-analysis-system
University course pre-registration system is built using Python django framework and sqlite3 database.  By this system university authority can know in advance how much student will take a particular course. Based upon that they can merge a section and predict how many instructor will be required. It will be helpful to assign retaken student to a section.
